# README

We use this repository to consolidate all monthly reports from our community contributors. Our LEAF reward to those contributors will be mostly based on these reports.

### How to submit your reports?

- If you are not a developer, please send your report to our (Jay Zhou)[mailto:jay@loopring.org], our CMO.
- If you are developer and have contributed pull requests, please send your report to (Daniel Wang)[mailto:daniel@loopring.org], our CEO.

### How often will you be paid?

We consolidate and publish contributors' report on a monthly basis. You can expect a reward within 1 week after the report is available.

### Do you have a standard for rewarding different contributions?

We don't have a well writen set of standards, but we  try to be fair. The rule of thumb is that part-time contributors will not paid as high as full-time employees who whould do the same job.
